# Security Audit

## Objective

The Security Audit project focused on conducting a comprehensive security assessment of a simulated corporate environment. The goal was to identify vulnerabilities, assess risk levels, and recommend mitigations to enhance the overall security posture. This project provided practical experience in vulnerability assessment methodologies and tools, emphasizing the importance of proactive security measures.

### Skills Learned

- In-depth knowledge of security audit frameworks and methodologies (e.g., NIST, OWASP).
- Understanding of risk assessment and management principles.
- Experience in documenting findings and developing actionable remediation strategies.
- Enhanced ability to communicate security risks and solutions to technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### Tools Used

- Manual testing techniques using web application security tools (like Burp Suite).
- Risk assessment frameworks for evaluating the severity of identified vulnerabilities.
- Reporting tools for documenting findings and recommendations.
